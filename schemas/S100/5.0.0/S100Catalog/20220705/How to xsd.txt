Note: contents of other parts of the official schema have been copied here and modified as needed. Changes include:
* downloaded xlink.xsd and store locally
* Modify most xsd's so they don't include the primary xsd from other xsd's. E.g., gmd/extent.xsd was modified so that it doesn't include gmd.xsd. Ensures as much as possible that only the XSD's actually needed for the S100 exchange catalog are used.
* Modify the gml stuff to use the newer namespace for gco (xmlns:gco="http://standards.iso.org/iso/19115/-3/gco/1.0" vice gco="http://www.isotc211.org/2005/gco"). Mostly impacts the files in schemas.opengis.net/iso/19139/20070417/*.
